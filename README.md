 
## 🔍 **Project Analysis: Password Generator Refactoring**

### 📌 Objective:

This project is based on an assignment from the "Ultimate C# Masterclass." The main task is to **refactor an existing Password Generator** to improve its code quality, maintainability, and testability.

### 🛠 Refactoring Goals:

* Make the code **cleaner** and more **modular**
* Follow the **Dependency Inversion Principle**
* Optionally introduce **Dependency Injection** and **unit testing**
* Maintain the same **functionality and behavior**

### 🧠 Key Improvements:

* Organized code into **reusable components**
* Abstracted randomness using an interface to support **mocking** for tests
* Improved naming, reduced duplication, and separated concerns
* Verified functionality through **manual testing** (and optionally unit testing)

# 🔐 Password Generator (Refactored)

This project is a clean and testable version of a password generator originally developed as part of the **Ultimate C# Masterclass**.

## 📦 Overview

The original implementation was functional but needed improvement in structure and testability. This refactored version focuses on:
- Clean code principles
- Separation of concerns
- Support for dependency injection and mocking
- Readability and maintainability

## 🎯 Features

- Generates random secure passwords
- Supports length customization
- Clean architecture for future enhancements
- Testable design using interfaces

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Password-Generator-Refactored.git
````

2. Open the solution in **Visual Studio**.

3. Build and run the project.

4. Use the console interface to generate secure passwords.

## 🔧 Navigation

| File / Folder              | Purpose                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `Pwd.cs`                   | Core logic of password generation           |
| `IRandomGenerator.cs`      | Interface for injectible randomness         |
| `SecureRandomGenerator.cs` | Real implementation of randomness generator |
| `Program.cs`               | Console UI to interact with password logic  |
| `README.md`                | Project overview and usage instructions     |

## 🧪 Testing

Although unit tests are optional, the refactored structure allows easy testing using mocking frameworks. You can implement tests by mocking the `IRandomGenerator` interface.

## 📚 Requirements

* .NET 6 or above
* Visual Studio 2022+
